					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a variable array based on our personal methods of transportation. My main ride is a 2021 Mazda3 that looks like this:</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I ran into was that my JavaScript console would print out an error instead of "undefined" when trying to declare my variables. It turned out that I forgot a comma after declaring the color's value.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Collin and I worked on the lab together and faced few problems. He helped me realize that I was missing a comma in one of my variables and also helped me figure out how to link the JavaScript file to my HTML file so that the output would be correct.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the output of the script we made.</p>
					<h3>Script Output</h3>
