                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a JavaScript loop that would display an output based on a factor system.</p>
            </div>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I accidentally did this lab in the wrong directory (lab 12 instead lab 13). I had to redo everything later on, and the CSS was also messed up because the site.css file was overwriting the centering of this page.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="results">
                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>I eventually got everything to work, despite the challenges that were tedious to fix. I now understand the importance of precision in coding, as well as the objective of the assignment, which was to experiment with loops. Below is the output of the program, which can be tested by pressing the "run" button.</p>

              <p>Which factors print what.</p>
