					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this assignment, we were tasked with making a JavaScript file about our primary method of transportation. I worked with my partner to explore variables and basic JavaScript data types. The car I'm working with here is the 2021 Mazda3 in Blue Mica.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had different methods of transportation, particularly different cars, so we had to do most of the assignment separately. I was also having a bit of trouble linking the JavaScript file to this webpage.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I learned how to use variables in JavaScript to define different strings and values. I experimented beforehand in the console with different functions as well.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
