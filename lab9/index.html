                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Our challenge for this lab was to experiment with jQuery and implement it into this website.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>The only problems that arose were simple syntax erorrs. For example, we had "." instead of "#", and we had to turn our class sections into id sections so that the "#" would work properly.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>We didn't have many issues with this assignment other from the syntax issues that me and my partner ended up resolving.</p>
