			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our task was to pseudocode an everyday task and a simple computer game. We did this by devising lists of instructions to carry out the necessary tasks needed to perform each action. If needed, we broke down tasks into simpler, smaller steps and sub-tasks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Simplifying tasks into understandable and concise instructions was difficult. Especially with our example of getting gas at a gas station, we realized that there are sometimes multiple ways to carry out the same desired outcome of something. We came together as partners and made decisions based on what made the most sense to us both.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Aside from having minor confusion on the instructions to the lab assignment, me and my partner did a good job of compiling our lists and pseudocoding. We spent a good amount of time revising and editing our work and pseudocode comments.</p>

				<p>Here are our lists we devised in our outline:</p>
				<h3>Task #1: Pseudocoding how to get gas from a gas station: </h3>
<pre><code>
Locate nearby gas stations.
Compare their prices, availability of gas pumps, and the gas station’s overall appearance (Is it shady-looking? If it is, pick a different option.)
Drive up to a pump with your car’s gas tank close to the gas pump.
Park the car, then turn off its engine.
Follow the instructions on the gas pump’s screen.
It will ask you to pre-authorize a payment method before selecting a fuel.
After payment, select the appropriate fuel premium for your car.
Open your car’s gas tank. You can usually do this by pressing down the cover, lifting it open, and twisting off the cap.
Take the nozzle from the gas pump.
Insert nozzle into the gas tank.
Hold down the trigger on the nozzle to release fuel into your car.
The nozzle will automatically stop fueling your car once the tank is full.
Remove the nozzle from your car and return it to the gas pump.
Screw the cap on your gas tank back in, usually until you hear a click, and then close the cover.
Take your receipt from the gas pump.
Get in your car and reset the odometer.
Ensure your dash’s fuel display correctly reflects that you’ve filled the tank.
If this is good to go, you’ve finished fueling your vehicle.
</pre></code>

<h3>Task #2: Creating a Cookie Clicker Game</h3>
<pre><code>
Display image of cookie
Accept user input
Display counter of cookies
Each 1 cookie click = +1 to the value of the cookie counter
Allow user to purchase upgrades using the number of cookies in the cookie counter
Each purchase will subtract an amount of cookies from the total number of cookies
Upgrades can increase the multiplier for the amount of cookies produced when the cookie is clicked, or give you tools to autoclick for you.
Earn achievements during progression
