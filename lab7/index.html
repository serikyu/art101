			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I was tasked with creating a JavaScript function that would take a user's inputted name and then sort it alphabetically. It would then call the function and print the sorted name as an output.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did come across any immediate issues. I tested out the script in js.bin to make sure it worked in both the output and console log panels.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am familiar with creating functions and did not have many issues with this assignment. I mostly referenced the example screenshot from the Lab 7 assignment page for help with the script, and I would probably struggle more without it. However, I understood the assignment as I went, trying to understand exactly what each line of code did. I did some cross-reference coding with my partner as well to make sure we were both achieving the correct objectives.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h3>When this page was opened, it asked the user for input. Here is the result of the sorted name from that input:</h3>
