			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The objective of this assignment is to understand file structure by adding a portait of myself to the homepage of my GitHub website and adding the links to all of the labs.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first, my selfie wouldn't show up in my file structure, even though I was putting it in a folder called ART 101. It turned out that I was putting it in the wrong folder, as the directory where this website is located is called art101, not ART 101.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>In this assignment, my lab partner and I worked mostly separately since this was more of a personal assignment where we had different images to add and different blurbs to associate ourselves with. It went mostly smoothly, but I was a little behind because I had my selfie.jpg in the wrong folder at first.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the file structure in my art 101	directory:</p>
